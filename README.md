Combinatorial Optimization Problems Project

There are three key points in the construction of an algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems, which are: representation of the solution; creation of initial solution / new solution within the feasible space; and conversion mechanism.

In this book I intend to present a literature review focused on these three topics, starting with assignment problems, then going through balancing, routing, and scheduling problems until finally arriving at complex mixed problems.

With a view to this purpose, the book will be divided into six chapters, with the first two chapters devoted to the presentation of important classes of combinatorial optimization problems (combinatorial optimization problems and mathematical modeling), the following three chapters devoted to the three key points previously discussed (representation of solutions, construction of viable solutions and search mechanisms), and the last chapter will be used for the presentation of known algorithms applied to different problems and a comparison between such algorithms.

This book started from the idea of creating a solver capable of solving combinatorial optimization problems of different classes.

This solver will have as its principle the identification of the nature of the problem, possibly through a neural network algorithm, and subsequent solution focusing on the three key points previously discussed.

Therefore, this book will be built together with the solver (in C++), which can be found in the solver folder of this same directory.

This project will be being developed together with other projects, so it will not be possible to develop it very quickly...

I hope this idea turns out to be very useful, relevant and interesting material.
